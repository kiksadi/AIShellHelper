chatGPT in you Linux shell

What is AI Shell Helper?
AI Shell Helper is a command-line assistant written in Python that brings the power of GPT-4 (via OpenAI's API) to the Linux terminal.

It helps users:

🔍 Understand shell commands (what does awk or tar -czvf really do?)

🛠️ Figure out how to do Linux tasks (like mounting drives or renaming files)

📜 Generate shell scripts from plain English descriptions

💬 Chat in REPL mode like a smart terminal buddy

🌟 Why it was built:
“I wanted a smarter, faster way to solve terminal problems without switching between windows or digging through Stack Overflow. This project started as a personal assistant and grew into something educational and time-saving.”
